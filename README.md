<h1>PLAYLISTIFY (A PERSONAL PROJECT)</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
  This project is a web application that allows a user to visualize their top spotify artists and create a playlist from the artists that they select. "PLAYLISTIFY" makes several requests to the Spotify API to retrieve user data and to post playlists to their account. For authorization, the program uses an auth flow with PKCE. The code's structure and logic is based off the structure of 'Receiptify' and Sam Codes' Spotify API tutorial.

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  I really enjoy listening to music and visualizing my Spotify data with webapps like Receiptify and Obscurify. I thought that this project would help expand my skills and knowledge in web development as well as combine my passions in coding and graphic design. It is my first real experience in front end web development, and the webapp has proved to be a useful tool in my daily life. I am able to curate and customize multiple playlists of different wtih little hassle.
